Notes: 
-[] Currently using dummy data. Need to convert JSON from fetch into JS. npm body-parse?
-[] The small, saved meme cards may need to have a button to pop up (modal) to show the full-size image.

## Challenges
- Testing this application was very challenging. Because the home page displays a random meme, it's impossible to consistently test for that specific meme. Hence, some of the testing is set up to ensure that an image is loaded and visible, but doesn't test for that specific image.
